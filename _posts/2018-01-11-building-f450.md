Flying a drone is an exhilarating experience! The thrill of flying and shooting in epic locations completely immersed in the pilot's view is hard to beat. It is something that many people are keen to take up however they often are unclear on how to build a drone, where to start. The biggest obstacle for many is getting their hands on their first drone with many hobbyists opting to build their own.


To build your own drone can feel like an intimidating task, and there’s a mountain of information to wade through before anything starts making sense. Fortunately, it’s not as hard as it sounds and with a little guidance you’ll be in the air in no time whilst picking up some practical skills! Initially, the idea might sound scary but anyone armed with the right information will be able to get on and do it relatively hassle free.

Building a drone is not neccessarily a cheap thing to do, not as it sound though. most of the people who tries to build drones find it as a good hobby and find themselfs checking and buying new gear and cool electorics all the time, therefore, sometime, buying a "ready-made" drone will end up cheaper.


#### Drone Specifications and Anatomy
The drone structure can be separated to several component each one can be replaced or upgrade depend on your needs.


###### 1. Frame
The frame is the main structure/skeleton of the drone, frame shape can be changed depend on the amount of engines and the payload your would like to carry.

###### 2. Motors
Motors provide the power to lift and push the drone up to the sky. the minimal amount of motors per multi-rotor can be 3 and the big ones can even have 8 engines.

###### 3. ESCs
ESC stands for Engine Speed controller, ESCs controls the current flow to each of the engines which translates to engine speed (RPMs). Every ariel vehicle drivn but electricity has ESC per motor.

###### 4. Flight Controller
Flight controller is the most safisticated component in any drone. The flight controller get input from several sensors (GPS, Barometer, etc..) and translate it to commands to each one of the ESCs together with the radio transmitter input.

###### 5. PDB
PDB stands for Power Distribution Board, PDB is a tiny board connecting the Battary to any of the drone electronics.
Many frames have bug electic circit as part of the plastic hold which give you the capability to bridge between the PDB and the rest of the electronic such as the ESCs. 

###### 6. Propellers
The 'wings' that gives the actual movement through the air. drone usually have pairs of propellers which moves in different directions, e.g. one pair clockwise (CW) and the other pairs are counter-clockwise (CCW).

###### 7. Battery
The 'fuel' of any ariel vehicle driven by electricity. Usually, the battery type is LiPo with 2-4 cells.

###### 8. Radio Transmitter
Remote control / Transmitter is an electronic device which produces radio wave with data regarding flight instructions and oriantation to be able to control the drone movement

###### 9. Radio Reciever
The reciver is installed on the drone and responsible of getting the direction intruction from the transmitter to push it to the flight controller

<br/>
The list above is a must for any multi-rotor ariel, it the basic things you need to got out there and fly it. 
Alought such a flight can be really nice it is still not what we expect to see or experiance when having flying a drone.
The list below is the extra staff you need inorder have a joyfull flight with you drone:

###### 1. FPV Camera
A simple camera to share the drone point of view

###### 2. Video Transmitter (VTX)
A video transmitter installed on the drone.

###### 3. Video Reciever/Goggles
Goggles/Video reciever allows you to the FPV camera installed on the drone

###### 4. Telemetry Transmitter
Telemetry module is responsible of sending data regarding the ariel vehicle itself, e.g temperature, speed, position..

###### 5. Telemetry Reciever
Same telemtry module also have a reciever which is responsible of recieving the data for the drone. the unit usually installed in some GCS (ground
control station or an advanced remote control)

#### Building a Drone
The best way to learn how to build a drone is to follow youtube lessons, e.g.

#### F450 Mark-1

This model is a great one for nubies, it have all the things you need to give you a great flying experiance. it fairly cheap, easy and safe for flight.
As a newbie, you will probably need to buy some more gear such as AC plugs or simple cables so you can soldier if needed.

#### F450 Mark-2

The previous model is indeed a great one, but after having sometime of flying and wondering, several limits needed to be challenged.
Mark-2 is based on the same gear as Mark-1 with some enhancments and upgrade.

<br/>

##### Conclusions
Mark-2 model is a very nice one however, technically, not a big change from Mark-1. Mark-2 performance brings us to a new limit that need to be handled, and this is the <b>Radio Transmitter</b>.

#### F450 Mark-3 (Yet to test and update)
Here comes the Tarannis era!<br/>following the conclusion of Mark-2, we now understand that the first barrier that needs be crossed is the Radio Transmitter.
Following a lot of research on the web and experiance pilots, Tarannis should give us a good "jump" ahead, it should take us to aproximetly 1.5Km (field-wise).
