Flying a drone is an exhilarating experience! The thrill of flying and shooting in epic locations completely immersed in the pilot's view is hard to beat. It is something that many people are keen to take up however they often are unclear on how to build a drone, where to start. The biggest obstacle for many is getting their hands on their first drone with many hobbyists opting to build their own.


To build your own drone can feel like an intimidating task, it did for me and there’s a mountain of information to wade through before anything starts making sense. Fortunately, it’s not as hard as it sounds and with a little guidance you’ll be in the air in no time whilst picking up some practical skills! Initially, the idea might sound scary but I firmly believe that anybody armed with the right information will be able to get on and do it relatively hassle free.

#### Drone Specifications and Anatomy
The drone structure can be separated to several component each one can be replaced or upgrade depend on your needs.


###### 1. The Frame
The frame is the main structure/skeleton of the drone, frame shape can be changed depend on the amount of engines and the payload your would like to carry.

###### 2. Motors
Motors provide the power to lift and push the drone up to the sky. the minimal amount of motors per multi-rotor can be 3 and the big ones can even have 8 engines.

###### 3. ESCs
ESC stands for Engine Speed Controler, ESCs controls the current flow to each of the engines which translates to engine speed (RPMs). Every ariel vehicle drivn but electricity has ESC per motor.

###### 4. Flight Controler
Flight controler is the most safisticated component in any drone. The flight controler get input from several sensors (GPS, Barometer, etc..) and translate it to commands to each one of the ESCs together with the radio transmitter input.

###### 5. PDB
PDB stands for Power Distribution Board, PDB is a tiny board connecting the Battary to any of the drone electronics.
Many frames have bug electic circit as part of the plastic hold which give you the capability to bridge between the PDB and the rest of the electronic such as the ESCs. 

###### 6. Propellers
The 'wings' that gives the actual movement through the air. drone usually have pairs of propellers which moves in different directions, e.g. one pair clockwise (CW) and the other pairs are counter-clockwise (CCW).

###### 7. Battery
The 'fuel' of any ariel vehicle driven by electricity. Usually, the battery type is LiPo with 2-4 cells.

###### 8. Transmitter
Remote control / Transmitter is an electronic device which produces radio wave with data regarding flight instructions and oriantation to be able to control the drone movement

###### 9. Reciever
The reciver is installed on the drone and responsible of getting the direction intruction from the transmitter to push it to the flight controller



The list above is a must for any multi-rotor ariel, it the basic things you need to got out there and fly it. 
Alought such a flight can be really nice it is still not what we expect to see or experiance when having flying a drone.
The list below is the extra staff you need inorder have a joyfull flight with you drone.

###### 9. FPV Camera
A simple camera to share the drone point of view
###### 10. VTX
A video transmitter installed on the drone.

###### 11. Video Reciever/Goggles
Goggles/Video reciever allows you to the FPV camera installed on the drone

#### Building a Drone
The best way to learn how to build a drone is to follow youtube lesson, e.g.
